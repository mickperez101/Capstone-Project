Kaptur,Counter-Strike 2,"The game was released in a broken, unfinished state, lacking content on top of all that. We are still missing a ton of maps and game modes... some stuff that was even teased in trailers and sneak peeks. This game should not have left the Beta so early. It is not ready for a full release. I will change my rating accordingly once it improves and more content is added. Currently, this is not an upgrade from CSGO. This is a downgrade.",2,

AMovieReference,Baldur's Gate 3,"This game was excellent. I had not played much of the other two games, but I am a big fan of what I've played from Larian studios, who made the Divinity series. This is essentially the best representation of DnD I've played in a video game, and has the option of making a custom character or an ""origin"" character that has their own goals and questlines. I rolled my own character, based on my actual dnd campaign I am currently playing, and feel like I got a great experience. This game has an amazing effect of making you wonder how things will play out the next time you play it, as there are often 2-5 different possible ways to tackle just about any quest you come across. After finishing the game, I immediately made a new character that has a more ""evil"" background (The Dark Urge), but I'm not sure if I want to give myself a break or not. As it is a Larian game, they will add more content as time goes on, and improve issues I've seen in the game. I may even consider doing playthroughs as origin characters, as they don't have true full endings unless you play as them, which is kinda cool for replay reasons, but disappointing if you just want a full experience.",4,Completed

GaddLadd,Baldur's Gate 3,This game is phenomenal. I am currently doing 2 playthrough of it and I still feel I have barely scratched the surface of what the game has to offer. Despite my usual disdain for fantasy worlds I can really appreciate how massive and well built the world is and it’s fun to look around and see the ripple effects of your actions. It is complex though really really complex and while I do love that intricacy in a video game it leaves a non DND fan like me having to look at some wiki’s and strategy guides for simple game mechanics. Also I do wish that traversing was more intuitive. You only have a few warp points at major locations and walking is rather slow. Also while I know the combat is based on DND I don’t know if I particularly find it balanced and getting bad rng means some fights will straight up obliterate you. I played on Normal Mode and random enemies would just get a combo and destroy you or an enemy could push you into a pit and one shot you. It’s not like fire emblem either where you can use the board and stats to anticipate what your opponent will do. Overall though it provides a complex and challenging experience with a good story and dynamic experience that’s different for all players.,4,Completed

Bulsy,Baldur's Gate 3,"Simply to play devil's advocate to the game that has received, by far, the highest amount of praise this year, I want to start by saying: Baldur's Gate 3 has plenty of issues that get handwaved away, issues that are glaringly present in some of this year's worst offending titles.Baldur's Gate 3 has UI issues,plentyof bugs, UX issues, balance issues, extremely long and boring fights (in some places), awful performance on its third act, and it released, by definition, unfinished, lacking a proper ending and only having its epilogue added three months later. Your party members also suck at following you, often refusing to jump, and the locked perspective and stiff camera controls made my head hurt so much I only got around it with a mod.While I understand that our companions are also insanely complex, taking into account that you can have any number of them, romance them, have them leave, and take different paths throughout their story, I found the pacing to be a little off sometimes; some companions get relevant content several times per act, others have one or two conversations every 30 hours. To make an unfair comparison to a linear story game, Persona 5 always managed to convince me, just like Baldur's Gate 3, that these were nearly real people I was interacting with; the difference lies in the fact that P5 presents you with constant conversations with every single one of your companions, and even has them interactall the timewith each other, which leads to the creation of a richer main cast, where you can truly feel like the game and these people exist outside of your playthrough and your interactions with them.I also found the gravitas of its final battle, and subsequent climax, lacking.But, its still my pick for GOTY. Its insanely well written individual characters, with their themes of abandonment, abuse, freedom and the power instilled by choosing your own destiny, as well as its insanely well constructed world, with characters that are so charismatic that make me want to be evil, makes it impossible for me to judge Baldur's Gate 3 as anything but a top-tier game and experience.Even the third act, commonly criticized as the worst one, gave me a genuine sense of satisfaction and immersion as I wandered the insanely dense streets of Baldur's Gate and met with characters whose lives had been impacted by choices I made thirty to sixty hours ago.I only criticize it so heavily for the same reason any one criticizes something they love: the flaws are glaring, but I love it dearly all the same; I mention those same flaws only out of admiration for everything else they have constructed with their writing team, be it in journals, lore books, conversations and dialogue trees and main storybeats and their pacing.It may not have wowed me with its group dynamic the same way Persona 5 did, and it may not have resonated deeply with me in the same way the themes of Disco Elysium did, but it is, nevertheless, a defining example of character writing, theme communication, world building and player freedom and choice.",5,Completed
laerugo,Baldur's Gate 3,"well I thought I liked RPGs but this is a game for people who REALLY like RPGs lmao. however after 12 hours I've discovered I like my reading RPGs to be the bookish kind, not the taxes kind.

Quell,Baldur's Gate 3,"After seeing how popular and how unanimously loved this game was I decided to try it out and see what all the hype was about, not being familiar in the slightest with DnD and RPG style turn based combat. But after playing the game for almost 5 hours I realized that this game and the genre is really just not meant for me, I don't have the brain power or patience to learn what every single move does during combat or how to properly utilize it, getting to a point where even combat on Explorer (easiest difficulty) became challenging and ended up frustrating me. I can see why this game is incredibly popular though, it won Game of The Year for a reason, It's just not my type of game and that's fine.",,Shelved

This is obviously wrong, but I’d rather talk about what makes me dislike BG3 so much, and why it is still a good game in spite of that.",3,Shelved
